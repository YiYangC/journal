## Seasonal / Series Ideas

- **Concrete Around the World** — A series tracing concrete use in different cities and climates
- **Material Close-ups** — Macro photography of architectural surfaces (grain, texture, weathering)
- **Architects' Houses** — Visiting homes designed by famous architects
- **Light Studies** — How light interacts with architecture at different times of day/year

---

## Writing Style Notes

- Contemplative, observational tone (like the portfolio: "For a material that takes the form of its form...")
- First person where appropriate — personal encounters with buildings
- Mix architectural knowledge with sensory description
- Let photographs carry the visual weight; text provides context and reflection
- Keep paragraphs short, leave space for the reader to think
