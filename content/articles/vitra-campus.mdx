<!--
The Vitra Campus is an argument made in buildings. Each structure stakes a position, and the landscape holds them together.

## A Collection of Architects

Few places on earth concentrate this much architectural ambition in so little space. Frank Gehry's Design Museum — his first building in Europe — twists and folds in white plaster. Across the path, Zaha Hadid's Fire Station slices through the ground in raw concrete, all angles and velocity. It was her first built work.

Tadao Ando's Conference Pavilion sits quietly among cherry trees, half-buried in the earth. Herzog & de Meuron's VitraHaus stacks domestic spaces like a child's drawing of houses, each volume rotated and cantilevered at improbable angles.

## The Vitra Design Museum

Gehry's museum is deceptively small from outside. Inside, the spiraling ramps and tilted walls create a disorienting spatial experience that forces you to reconsider how you move through a building. The galleries resist the rectangular — every wall meets the ceiling at a different angle.

> Architecture is not about form. It is about many other things. The form is the result.

## Industrial Landscape

The campus began not as a cultural destination but as a furniture factory. After a fire destroyed the original production halls in 1981, Vitra's chairman invited architects he admired to rebuild — one building at a time. The result is an accidental museum of contemporary architecture, set among working factories and warehouses.

The tension between industry and culture gives the campus its character. Delivery trucks pass Gehry's sculptural forms. Workers eat lunch in the shadow of Hadid's concrete planes. Architecture here is not precious — it coexists with the ordinary.

## Buckminster Fuller's Dome

At the edge of the campus, a geodesic dome by Buckminster Fuller has been relocated and restored. Inside, it contains nothing — just the structure itself, the geometry of triangulated surfaces enclosing air. It is the purest statement on campus: architecture as idea, reduced to its minimum.
