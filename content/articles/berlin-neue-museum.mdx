The Neues Museum sits on Berlin's Museum Island, a UNESCO World Heritage site threaded through the Spree. Friedrich August Stüler built it between 1843 and 1855 as a companion to Schinkel's Altes Museum next door. Allied bombing left the building a roofless shell for decades; the DDR let it stand open to the elements while the rest of the island was slowly patched together.

David Chipperfield won the competition to restore it in 1997. What he proposed was neither faithful replica nor stark contemporary insertion. Broken brickwork meets smooth recycite plaster. Original painted ceilings survive alongside rooms where raw aggregate walls carry the memory of what was lost. The approach earned the 2011 Mies van der Rohe Award.

Walking through, the building keeps switching registers — ornate Egyptian halls give way to stripped volumes where daylight falls across surfaces that refuse to pretend the twentieth century didn't happen. It is a museum about museums, about the distance between preservation and erasure.
