The Vaillancourt Fountain sits in Embarcadero Plaza at the foot of Market Street, forty feet of precast concrete tubes stacked into an angular mass that pumps thirty thousand gallons of water per minute when running. Québécois artist Armand Vaillancourt completed it in 1971, working with landscape architect Lawrence Halprin. The commission had a practical motive: the Embarcadero Freeway loomed directly behind, and the fountain was meant to drown out its noise and break the visual monotony of elevated concrete with intentional concrete.

The freeway came down after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The fountain stayed. Stripped of its original context, the sculpture became harder to read — a brutalist object without the brutalist infrastructure it was designed to answer. Vaillancourt scratched "Québec Libre!" into the wet concrete during the dedication, folding political protest into public art before anyone could stop him.

San Francisco has argued about the fountain for decades. The Art Commission voted to remove it, citing structural concerns, with disassembly planned for 2026. Whether it returns remains uncertain. For now it stands dry more often than wet, 710 tons of reinforced concrete holding its ground at the edge of the bay.
