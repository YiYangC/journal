The Luodong Cultural Working House is not a building in the conventional sense. It is a roof — an enormous steel canopy lifted high above the ground on slender columns, sheltering a public plaza that remains open on all sides.

## The Big Roof

Huang Sheng-Yuan calls it a 大棚子 — a big shed. The structure spans roughly 70 meters, creating a covered outdoor space large enough for markets, performances, exhibitions, or simply standing in the shade during a Yilan rainstorm. The roof floats above the ground at varying heights, its steel trusses exposed and unadorned.

Beneath the canopy, nothing is fixed. The ground is open, flexible, unfinished. The building's program is whatever the town decides it should be on any given day.

## Working House

The name is deliberate. This is not a cultural center — it is a cultural working house. The distinction matters. A center implies a finished institution with permanent programs. A working house implies process, labor, incompleteness. The building is always becoming something.

> Architecture does not have to be a finished product. It can be a framework for things that haven't happened yet.

## Yilan Weather

The design responds to Yilan County's climate — subtropical, wet, frequently typhoon-swept. A conventional building would need to defend against the rain. The Cultural Working House simply lets the rain through where it wants and keeps the gathering space dry where it matters. The open sides allow wind to pass freely, preventing the uplift forces that destroy enclosed structures in typhoons.

## Public Life

On weekends, the space fills with vendors, families, performers. On weekdays, it is quieter — students practice dance routines, elderly residents do morning exercises under the canopy's shade. The building does not dictate these uses. It merely permits them, holding open a space in the town for whatever the town needs.
