I have always wanted to design theater sets — for repeatedly-told stories, films existing only in cinema, and numerous untold narratives. This project functions as an ongoing archive of stories and their symbols.

The approach prioritizes extracting central visual symbols through abstraction while minimizing input parameters. Midjourney contributes its own interpretive layer to the creative process.

## Throne of Blood (1957)

Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth, set in feudal Japan. The fog, the forest, the fortress — reduced to their essential geometries.

## Vertigo (1958)

Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, defined by its signature green. The spiral, the fall, the doubling — abstracted into spatial composition.

## The Sacrifice of Iphigenia

The classical play rendered as architectural space. Sacrifice, altar, the weight of duty against nature.

## Psycho (1960)

Hitchcock again — the house on the hill, the shower, the divide between the seen and unseen.

## Dolce Vita (1960)

Fellini's Rome. The fountain, the boulevard, the spectacle of modern life stripped to its theatrical bones.

## Chungking Express (1994)

Wong Kar-wai's Hong Kong. Neon, corridors, the compression of loneliness into tight urban spaces.

## Brave New World

Huxley's dystopia given form. The laboratory, the conditioning room, the illusion of paradise.

## The Mythology of Sisyphus

The absurd made spatial. The hill, the boulder, the eternal return — Camus rendered as stage.

## Space Opera as a Genre

The cosmos as theater. Vastness and intimacy, the ship as stage, the void as audience.
