Drawing from architecture and psychoanalysis, I propose analyzing Alfred Hitchcock's films through the lens of thresholds. The framework examines tension between abstraction and materialization, arguing that perversion is introduced into the films and the uncanniness of spaces is experienced at these boundary points.

## Threshold Definition

A threshold functions as both a literal architectural element and an abstract narrative concept. It is a barrier space that is located for separating the volumes, while acknowledging broader manifestations including doors, windows, passages, arches, screens, openings, and even some sub-spaces. Thresholds serve dual purposes: connecting and differentiating spaces while signaling transitions between distinct atmospheres or conditions.

## Narrative Context

Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey" framework positions threshold-crossing as a critical transformation from the ordinary world to the unknown. Key characteristics include: the crossing may be willing or unwilling, typically involves physical boundaries, and often permits no return. This dynamic appears frequently in Hitchcock's cinema.

## Methodological Approach

The identified thresholds are meant to provide analogous and productive readings rather than exhaustive categorization. The analysis integrates both architectural and narrative theory perspectives, examining how Hitchcock constructs spatial tension through the deliberate deployment of threshold moments — the door that should not be opened, the window that reveals too much, the passage that transforms the one who crosses it.
