The headphone jack recently resurfaced in my life. Before the pandemic, this interface had grown increasingly distant. I'm not an audiophile concerned with lossless quality — I embraced wireless freedom early. My last extended wired headphone use was 2014. After Beats launched wireless models in 2012, I abandoned daily jack-plugging rituals. With Bluetooth's rise, the headphone wire has disappeared like a tail that humans evolved away from.

## Connection Reimagined

When discussing headphone connections, the interface has shifted from physical ports to metaphorical language. What was once literal wire-and-jack pairing now means swipes and clicks on a screen. The abstracted interface lacks physical form; connection limits depend on virtual lists rather than hardware ports.

## The Pandemic Pivot

The critical turning point coincided with my transition from in-person to remote work and study starting March 2020. Conversations transformed into a process of converting human voices to vibrations, then electronic signals, and finally decoding them back to the human voice.

## Theory of Communication

Headphones function as mirrored interfaces where "listening" and "speaking" operate in feedback loops. During my university years (2016–2019), I accumulated 88,294 Spotify minutes annually — roughly four hours daily. Wearing headphones meant entering my own world, stepping into another place, isolated from the actual geo-location.

Pre-pandemic, headphones primarily served listening functions. I wore Bose QC over-ear headphones and AirPods Pro but rarely used microphone features seriously.

## The Adaptation Crisis

The pandemic forced headphones to manage speaking functions too. Remote meetings created constant friction: every time I jumped onto a video conference window, I always forgot to stop the music or switch my microphone. Two obstacles emerged:

1. **Technical switching difficulties:** Apple's AirPods automatic connection resembles a wild guessing game.
2. **Behavioral retraining:** Noise-canceling isolation made returning to reality difficult.

The physical disconnection between the human ear and headphones actually represents the connection between people. Removing headphones became a modern equivalent of doffing one's hat — a ritual showing respect.

Only when listening and speaking combine does a true interface between the user and the world emerge.

## Return to Wired

By mid-2021, I returned to wired AirPods. The advantages include: no charging dependency, stable and predictable connections, better microphone pickup with reduced latency, sufficient sound quality, and maintained ambient sound awareness.

## Product Philosophy

Wired headphones' return represents restoration of the original MVP function: connection itself. Early headphones simply transmit sound from distant ends, connecting information and communication between both sides.

## Cultural Context

Millennial media depicted youth in dramatic over-ear headphones, ready to plug their ears and fight against the entire real world. Post-2012 Beats popularity normalized exaggerated designs. Future possibilities resembled the film *Her* — everyone isolated in wireless bubbles.

Yet the pandemic shifted perspectives. Questions about whether one can hear and be heard, whether they can connect with the world, reflected core contemporary anxieties. Wired headphones' resurgence represented our response to this issue. We use wired connections to combat the social distancing between people brought by the pandemic.

## The Telephone Game

Returning to communication fundamentals, the children's game "telephone" illustrates information distortion inevitably occurring through translation and conversion. Despite physical stability, interfaces remain fragile and naïve. Solutions may require more direct interfaces between people and machines, and between people — and biological interfaces may be the direction we are heading towards.
